    Title: Racket News - Issue 29
    Date: 2020-04-14T21:00:00

Welcome to the twenty-nineth issue of [Racket](https://www.racket-lang.org) News. 

This issue should have come out April 6 (Monday last week). However, due to the current global situation and my own personal inner crisis, I had not feeling 100% and so decided to take last week off from online presence and although I initially thought I would be able to publish Racket News, that didn't happen. The schedule is not slightly skewed since issue 30 should be out next Monday, April 20 but it doesn't make much sense since things have been quiet in Racket world. 

Therefore, we will resume normal schedule with issue 30 in the beginning of May. So issue 30 comes out May 4, issue 31 comes out May 18, and so on. 

Until the next issue, stay safe, stay healthy and stay indoors.

Grab yourself a strong espresso, and enjoy!

# What's New?

* Up until recently it was only possible to embed Racket BC in a program, but not Racket CS. According to Matthew in a [recent email](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/YHjoCYcC6hQ/sDu-1ce9BQAJ) that has changed and there is some snapshot [documentation already available](https://www.cs.utah.edu/plt/snapshots/current/doc/inside/cs-embedding.html).
* John Clements [announced](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-dev/c3OQIBJ9N0M/uhgySQWUBwAJ) the release process for Racket v7.7 has begun.
    * April 7: Branch day, merge window starts
	* April 25: Merge window ends, testing starts
	* April 22: Testing ends

# Project in the Spotlight

This week's project in the spotlight is [Deta](https://deta.defn.io/) ([src](https://github.com/Bogdanp/deta)/[pkg](https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/deta)) by Bodgan Popa.

From the website:

> This library automatically maps database tables to Racket structs and lets you perform CRUD operations on them as well as arbitrary queries. Sort of like an ORM, but without associations and all the bad bits.

# Featured Racket Paper

This issue's featured paper is [Towards Practical Gradual Typing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10UIZFb8zYKtsR8qaoW32THKFpPecxGqS/view?usp=sharing) by Asumu Takikawa, Daniel Felty, Earl Dean, Matthew Flatt, Robert Bruce Findler, Sam Tobin-Hochstadt and Matthias Felleisen.

Abstract:

> Over the past 20 years, programmers have embraced dynamically-typed programming languages.By now, they have also come to realize that programs in these languages lack reliable type in-formation for software engineering purposes. Gradual typing addresses this problem; it empowersprogrammers to annotate an existing system with sound type information on a piecemeal basis.This paper presents an implementation of a gradual type system for a full-featured class-basedlanguage as well as a novel performance evaluation framework for gradual typing.
