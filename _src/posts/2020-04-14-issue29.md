    Title: Racket News - Issue 29
    Date: 2020-04-14T21:00:00

Welcome to the twenty-nineth issue of [Racket](https://www.racket-lang.org) News. 

This issue should have come out April 6 (Monday last week). However, due to the current global situation and my own personal inner crisis, I had not feeling 100% and so decided to take last week off from online presence and although I initially thought I would be able to publish Racket News, that didn't happen. The schedule is not slightly skewed since issue 30 should be out next Monday, April 20 but it doesn't make much sense since things have been quiet in Racket world. 

Therefore, we will resume normal schedule with issue 30 in the beginning of May. So issue 30 comes out May 4, issue 31 comes out May 18, and so on.

# What's New?

<!-- * Last week [RacketFest](https://racketfest.com), organized by Jesse Alama, took place in Berlin, Germany. Unfortunately, I was unable to join but from [the](https://twitter.com/mrcwhl/status/1233434679107358720) [several](https://twitter.com/joergenbr/status/1233157000441274369) [comments](https://twitter.com/alexshendi/status/1233163089337561095) [on](https://twitter.com/spdegabrielle/status/1233373042505658369) [twitter](https://twitter.com/THISISDINOSAUR/status/1233434296913887234) it seems to have been yet another success. Thanks to Jesse for RacketFest! -->
<!-- * Sage Gerard is [starting a syntax highlighter project](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/KgnocORsBt8/Wzrb7RuNBwAJ). If this is something that interests you, join the discussion! -->
<!-- * Would you be interested in a [Racket Meetup in London](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/sklZiVBOIGU/b9L4j5ktCQAJ)? If so, chime in! -->
<!-- * Stephen de Gabrielle ran a quick [racket editor survey](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/PdL-O9sFiVo/QUTxxdJiCQAJ), whose results are [now online](https://de.surveymonkey.com/results/SM-GBD6J7ST7/). The same survey took place in [slack as well](https://racket.slack.com/archives/C06V96CKX/p1582485281026300). -->
<!-- * Matthew Butterick started an interesting thread on coding differences between RacketBC (the current Racket - BC stands for *Before Chez*) and RacketCS. It is definitely [worth a read](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/r01YPGBDV-g/z0H-tRrPCAAJ)! -->

# Project in the Spotlight

This week's project in the spotlight is [Deta](https://deta.defn.io/) ([src](https://github.com/Bogdanp/deta)/[pkg](https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/deta)) by Bodgan Popa.

From the website:

> This library automatically maps database tables to Racket structs and lets you perform CRUD operations on them as well as arbitrary queries. Sort of like an ORM, but without associations and all the bad bits.

# Featured Racket Paper

This issue's featured paper is [Towards Practical Gradual Typing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10UIZFb8zYKtsR8qaoW32THKFpPecxGqS/view?usp=sharing) by Asumu Takikawa, Daniel Felty, Earl Dean, Matthew Flatt, Robert Bruce Findler, Sam Tobin-Hochstadt and Matthias Felleisen.

Abstract:

> Over the past 20 years, programmers have embraced dynamically-typed programming languages.By now, they have also come to realize that programs in these languages lack reliable type in-formation for software engineering purposes. Gradual typing addresses this problem; it empowersprogrammers to annotate an existing system with sound type information on a piecemeal basis.This paper presents an implementation of a gradual type system for a full-featured class-basedlanguage as well as a novel performance evaluation framework for gradual typing.
