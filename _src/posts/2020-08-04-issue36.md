    Title: Racket News - Issue 36
    Date: 2020-08-04T21:00:00

Welcome to the thirty-sixth issue of [Racket](https://www.racket-lang.org) News. 

Racket News is [now hosted](https://github.com/pmatos/racket-news) on GitHub. Pages are hosted on a dedicated server instead of Gitlab Pages. That improved the page responsiveness. I am also working on a new design and logo - stay tuned. Feel free to open issues in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/pmatos/racket-news/issues) for suggestions and ideas for future issues.

This week we also have Racket 7.8, more blog posts, more packages, a video from Matthew on Continuation Marks and lots of news. 

New in this issue is the section [*Call to Racket!*](#calltoracket) which will feature a Racket issue suggestion that needs fixing. If you ever needed a reason to hack on Racket, this is it. For every RN, there will be a new featured issue and I will mention contributors to fixes here as well. Thanks to Stephen De Gabrielle for the section suggestion.

Coffee time...
Enjoy!

# What's New?

* [Racket 7.8](https://blog.racket-lang.org/2020/08/racket-v7-8.html) is here, with many improvements. Among them support for AArch32 and AArch64 (that's ARM 32 and 64 bits) and an incremental garbage collection mode that can eliminate long GC pauses for some applications - all of this in Racket CS. But there's more - read the full announcement for more details.
* The Racket Survey is now closed! Thanks to all who took the time to fill it in, time to analyze the results.
* Matthew Flatt posted a [Racket CS Release](https://groups.google.com/g/racket-users/c/EP-vsV62UcQ/m/SCVNSEGbAgAJ) Plan to the list. Racket CS is already the default in the `master` branch of the `racket` repository (see this [thread](https://groups.google.com/g/racket-dev/c/IR3dOLlyCD4/m/9UalMneEDAAJ))- so we'll be seeing it the default release if all goes to plan. If you're not using it yet, what are you waiting for to switch?
* A new [video from Matthew on Continuation Marks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfxsM4TC8Yw) for your movie evening - get the popcorn ready!
* There's a new [IntelliJ Racket](https://github.com/aymanosman/intellij-racket) [plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14752-racket) in town by `aymanosman`. If you're an IntelliJ user, be sure to give it a try and provide feedback.

# Call to Racket!

Welcome to our new section *Call to Racket!*, where we will feature a single issue for you to try and fix before the next RN issue comes out (issue [planning is here](https://github.com/pmatos/racket-news/milestones)). I will keep my eyes peeled for contributions and will ensure that contributors to the fix are mentioned once the fix is merged.

For this week I have chosen an easy one. [Security issue 248](https://github.com/racket/racket/security/code-scanning/248) in [`racket/racket`](https://github.com/racket/racket). Apparently variable `notdisplay` is set but never read, therefore the store is reported as dead. How do you get this fixed?

Good luck! 

<small><strong>Edit (05.08.2020):</strong> Unfortunately the security issues in GitHub are not public, so I have recreated it as a [public issue (number 3336)](https://github.com/racket/racket/issues/3336).</small>

<div id='spotlight'/>
# Project in the Spotlight

Generally I do not feature projects that have been just created, but I feel like this is ambitious and serious enough that it deserves an early spotlight. I hope you agree.

This week's project in the spotlight is [zcpkg](https://github.com/zyrolasting/zcpkg) by Sage Gerard.

From the website:

> A flexible package manager for Racket.
>
> Benefits
>
> * You can install the exact code you asked for.
> * You can make links to the exact versions of packages you need in your projects.
> * You can use packages that would otherwise conflict in the same Racket installation.
> * You can introduce package code starting from zero trust.
> * You can publish breaking changes whenever you want.
> * You can organize your files however you want.
> * You can use your own package namespace.
> * You can define deliverables with more creative freedom, outside of PLT's recipes.
> * You can strictly separate third-party code from your Racket installation.

# Featured Racket Paper

This issue's featured paper is [Hygienic Macro Expansion](https://drive.google.com/file/d/186xITEewAPR2VRF9S8DpDK56o8XkQRoD/view?usp=sharing), by Eugene Kohlbecker, Daniel P. Friedman, Matthias Felleisen and Bruce Duba

Abstract:

> Macro expansion in current Lisp systems is naive with respect with block structure. Every macro function can cause the capture of free user identifiers and thus corrupt intended bindings. We propose a change to the expansion algorithm so that macros will only violate the binding discipline when it is explicitly intended.

<small><strong>Edit (05.08.2020):</strong> Thanks to Laurent Orseau for suggesting a [more readable version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tg-o3rl0DS7PcrG1xgHerSwT4j0DUQ8E/view?usp=sharing) of this paper.</small>
