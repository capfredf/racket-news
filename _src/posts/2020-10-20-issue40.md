    Title: Racket News - Issue 40
    Date: 2020-10-20T21:00:00

Welcome to the fortieth issue of [Racket](https://www.racket-lang.org) News.

Racket is in an exciting place and there was no place better to see that than in the community that joined Gather last weekend for RacketCon 2020. Due to the global pandemic, we did not manage to get together in-person but we still spent some time together discussing all things Racket and socializing in Gather's virtual environment. This issue is packed with information including links to videos for all the talks in RacketCon. I can't wait to see what next year will bring us - hope you are excited as I am.

Grab an espresso and enjoy!

# Call to Racket!

Want to contribute to Racket? Don't know where to start? Each RN issue I choose an easy issue to fix to get you started contributing to Racket. Come, give it a go.

This week I (happily) had my plans squashed by our last "Call to Racket" champion `xxyzz`. I created issue [#3446](https://github.com/racket/racket/issues/3446) for this issue's "Call to Racket" but before I could press "Publish" on this issue, `xxyzz` created PR [#3447](https://github.com/racket/racket/pull/3447) to fix it (way to go `xxyzz` - thanks for the fix). Therefore I will once again issue a call to fix [issue 3161](https://github.com/racket/racket/issues/3161). If you are interested in fixing this but need some guidance, feel free to comment on the issue page. Will you be our next Champion?

Good luck!

# Project in the Spotlight

This week's project in the spotlight is [Plot](https://docs.racket-lang.org/plot/index.html) by Neil Toronto, currently maintained by Alex Harsányi.

From the website:

> The Plot library provides a flexible interface for producing nearly any kind of plot. It includes many common kinds of plots already, such as scatter plots, line plots, contour plots, histograms, and 3D surfaces and isosurfaces. Thanks to Racket’s excellent multiple-backend drawing library, Plot can render plots as interactive snips in DrRacket, as picts in slideshows, as PNG, PDF, PS and SVG files, or on any device context.

# Featured Racket Paper

This issue's featured paper is [Corpse Reviver: Sound and Efficient Gradual Typing via Contract Verification](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ogGwX9bJH9ZvccFjvTWpZFY757T1z5Gr/view?usp=sharing) by Cameron Moy, Phúc C. Nguyễn, Sam Tobin-Hochstadt, and David van Horn.

Abstract:

> Gradually-typed programming languages permit the incremental addition of static types to untyped programs. To remain sound, languages insert run-time checks at the boundaries between typed and untyped code. Unfortunately, performance studies have shown that the overhead of these checks can be disastrously high, calling into question the viability of sound gradual typing. In this paper, we show that by building on existing work on soft contract verification, we can reduce or eliminate this overhead.
> Our key insight is that while untyped code cannot be trusted by a gradual type system, there is no need to consider only the worst case when optimizing a gradually-typed program. Instead, we statically analyze the untyped portions of a gradually-typed program to prove that almost all of the dynamic checks implied by gradual type boundaries cannot fail, and can be eliminated at compile time. Our analysis is modular, and can be applied to any portion of a program.
> We evaluate this approach on a dozen existing gradually-typed programs previously shown to have prohibitive performance overhead — with a median overhead of 3.5x and up to 73.6x in the worst case — and eliminate all overhead in most cases, suffering only 1.6x overhead in the worst case.
