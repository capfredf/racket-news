    Title: Racket News - Issue 9
    Date: 2019-06-03T21:00:00

Welcome to the ninth issue of [Racket](https://www.racket-lang.org) News. 

First and foremost, my apologies for the delay to this issue, which should have come out on the first of the month. Hopefully you are registered to the newsletter and didn't stress about it because I [forewarned you](https://mailchi.mp/28eb74195183/racket-news-issue-coming-real-soon-tm?e=a3aed1f0c8).

I had promised to provide statistics for more repositories besides Racket from this issue onwards but it won't happen yet. Gustavo Massaccesi asked for this back in issue 5 and I promised to do it but the lack of Github bindings in Racket is delaying the implementation. Vincent St-Amour has pointed to me that some work has been done to [obtain some statistics](https://github.com/racket/release-catalog/blob/master/scripts/get-contributors.rkt) and this definitely helps but I need to GitHub related data like PRs and issues which needs to be implemented. I haven't time to do this yet so my apologies.

Jesse Alama suggested some time ago that it would be nice to have a link to a [Racket donation page](https://racket-lang.org/sfc.html), i.e. to _donate to the Racket Programming language_ - not [Racket News](https://racket-news.com), which I wholeheartedly agreed with. I have initially decided to include this in the Racket News main page only, instead of including it on every issue. If you have further suggestions related to this I am happy to hear them.

Last week, John Clements reported that the Racket News website was down. Yes, my fault! You might have noticed that I migrated the Racket News repository to Gitlab and while I did this and changed DNS servers, the website went down. The sole reason for the move is to allow for private issues. If you want to submit some issue for my eyes only, until the time comes to be published you can now do so by opening an issue in [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/racket-news/racket-news.gitlab.io/issues/new) and clicking on _This issue is confidential and should only be visible to team members with at least Reporter access._.

A request for help is due... You might have noticed my poor CSS skills on the webpage. If you have the time and wish to contribute some ideas and fixes to the design and layout of Racket News, I welcome them all. 

Now onto the serious business - we have a packed issue. Buckle up, hold on to your seats, grab a triple espresso and enjoy.

# What's New?

* [RacketCon website](https://con.racket-lang.org/) has been updated with information about keynote, social events and more. Check it out!
* Jesse Alama has [tweeted](https://twitter.com/alamajesse/status/1134332574631911425) that [Racketfest](https://racketfest.com) 2019 proceedings are [now available](https://gumroad.com/l/racketfest-2019-proceedings);
* Matthias Felleisen [posted](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/X8ri2_fjS8Q/ZLpT2l5IBwAJ) a [solution in Racket](https://github.com/mfelleisen/7GUI/) to the [7GUI](https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/) problem;
* Matthew Flatt wants to know if you [use single-flonums](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/Di-fTifWyWg/J_GQ2_3hBwAJ). Apparently they are a burden to add to ChezScheme and therefore future Racket, therefore if you have a very good reason to keep them join the conversation;
* John Clements has recently [posted some links](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/LecJuyjg15U/Tbb4FT0JBAAJ) to Jeremy Siek's compilers class which uses Racket to compile itself into `x86`;

```
raco pkg install dynamic-ffi

# Project in the Spotlight

This week's project in the spotlight is [Rebellion](https://github.com/jackfirth/rebellion), by Jack Firth.

From the documentation:

> Rebellion is a set of infrastructure libraries for Racketeers to build new languages, new frameworks, and new tools with.

If that doesn't say enough, take a look at its [documentation](https://docs.racket-lang.org/rebellion/index.html).

<div id='featuredpaper'/>
# Featured Racket Paper

As we know, Matthew Flatt has been working relentelessly on [Racket-on-Chez](https://blog.racket-lang.org/2019/01/racket-on-chez-status.html) - the Racket running on a ChezScheme backend. If we want to understand the future Racket it's worth it to start by reading up on its foundations. From R. Kent Dybvig, this issue brings us [The Development of Chez Scheme](https://www.cs.indiana.edu/%7Edyb/pubs/hocs.pdf).

Abstract:

> Chez Scheme is now over 20 years old, the first version having been released in 1985. This paper takes a brief look back on the history of Chez Schemeâ€™s development to explore how and why it became the system it is today.

Please note I am not hosting any of these files, but instead I am linking to the PDFs hosted by the researchers themselves. If you think there is a better way to do this or if I should host the files myself, [drop me a line](mailto:pmatos@linki.tools).
