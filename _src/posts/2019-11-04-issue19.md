Welcome to the nineteenth issue of [Racket](https://www.racket-lang.org) News. 
	
There is quite a bit of activity in Racket World so this is another issue packed with goodies - GameJam, more Vulkan work, a video about `syntax-parse`, and transducers in Racket among other things. I won't be keeping you any longer. Dig in!

Grab a flat white and enjoy!

# What's New?

* The [Racket GameJam](https://itch.io/jam/racket-2019-gamejam) is on! Submissions due in 25 days - give it a go.
* In [issue 9](https://racket-news.com/2019/06/racket-news-issue-9.html#spotlight) we have featured the amazing [rebellion](https://github.com/jackfirth/rebellion) package by Jack Firth. Since we last featured it, Jack has added many new exciting features. [Recently](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/AxNC_9Xivlo/HGr5wq6CAQAJ) he has announced support for [Transducers](https://docs.racket-lang.org/rebellion/Transducers.html) - go give them a try.
* Evžen Wybitul is developing [Magic Racket](https://github.com/Eugleo/magic-racket), a VS Code plugin for Racket and has [announced](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/WTolfJ_Hy0Q/qY6ULdZ7AQAJ) REPL integration.
* Sage Gerard who has been working on [Vulkan](https://www.amd.com/de/technologies/vulkan) integration for Racket in [`racket-vulkan`](https://github.com/zyrolasting/racket-vulkan), has [announced](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/-FZt-SoQWKU/8RK8zB6mBwAJ) that a non-trivial application is now working: [rendering of a Mandelbrot set](https://github.com/zyrolasting/racket-vulkan/blob/13b813280193ee8e885a522b5949e90c5f1ad5f0/examples/mandelbrot/mandelbrot.rkt).
* Want to understand better `syntax-parse` (we all do...)? Check out this [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im-iNri_3gg) by Ryan Culpepper on Syntax Templates in Racket.

# New Releases

If you know of library releases or maybe your own libraries and you want them to be featured, please [let me know](mailto:pmatos@linki.tools).

* `rackunit-fancy-runner`([src](https://github.com/c2d7fa/rackunit-fancy-runner/)/[pkg](https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/rackunit-fancy-runner)) by `c2d7fa` provides a way to run RackUnit test suites in the command lines that has a fancier output format than the built-in `rackunit/text-ui`.

# Project in the Spotlight

This week's project in the spotlight is [Herbie](https://herbie.uwplse.org/), which is an application to automatically improve the error of floating point expressions by Pavel Panchekha, Alex Sanchez-Stern, David Thien, Zachary Tatlock, Jason Qiu, Jack Firth, and James R. Wilcox.

From the website:

> Herbie automatically rewrites floating point expressions to make them more accurate. Floating point arithmetic is inaccurate; hence the jokes that 0.1 + 0.2 ≠ 0.3 for a computer. But it is hard to understand and fix these inaccuracies, creating mysterious and hard-to-fix bugs. Herbie is a tool to help. 

Herbie has excellent [documentation](https://herbie.uwplse.org/doc.html), [tutorial](https://herbie.uwplse.org/doc/latest/tutorial.html) and [support](https://mailman.cs.washington.edu/mailman/listinfo/herbie). The PLDI'15 paper introducing Herbie is also [online](https://herbie.uwplse.org/pldi15.html).

# Featured Racket Paper

This issue's featured paper is [Binding as Sets of Scopes](https://drive.google.com/open?id=13CJsXS12vX3X-r9EnfMQRDl0BBoQMxHr) by Matthew Flatt.

Abstract:

> Our new macro expander for Racket builds on a novel approach to hygiene. Instead of basing macro expansion on variable renamings that are mediated by expansion history, our new expander tracks binding through a set of scopes that an identifier acquires from both binding forms and macro expansions. The resulting model of macro expansion is simpler and more uniform than one based on renaming, and it is sufficiently compatible with Racket’s old expander to be practical.

There is also an [extended version](https://www.cs.utah.edu/plt/scope-sets/) if the paper was not enough fun.
