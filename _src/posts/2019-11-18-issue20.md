    Title: Racket News - Issue 20
    Date: 2019-11-18T21:00:00

Welcome to the twentieth issue of [Racket](https://www.racket-lang.org) News. 
	
Unusually I am writing this issue quite late in the day (in my timezone anyway) and as I look to my notes and to everything that has happened since the last issue, it feels like there are quite a few things to mention. As usual I will do my best to touch all of the important developments of the last two weeks - if I miss something [let me know](mailto:pmatos@linki.tools) and if where you are, you get this a day later, my apologies.

Grab an Americano and enjoy!

# What's New?

* Release 7.5 is almost here - being [tagged](https://github.com/racket/racket/tree/v7.5) just over 3 hours ago but unfortunately a proper release announcement won't make this issue.
* We mentioned in the last issue Jack Firth's [transducer](https://docs.racket-lang.org/rebellion/Transducers.html) work in the [rebellion](https://github.com/jackfirth/rebellion) package - he is [now looking](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/k865tegS1ZM/IVld1atoAAAJ) for early adopters. Join in if you can help.
* I have posted the [status and a proposal for the future of Racket CI](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-dev/RYeXav6CXnQ/GD7qr73BBAAJ) to the `dev` mailing list. If you would like to help, join us on slack new `#ci` room - if you're not into slack, [get in contact](mailto:pmatos@linki.tools) with me.
* No updates have been made to the [RacketCon webpage](https://con.racket-lang.org) but after a short poll Shriram Krishnamurthi has [announced on twitter](https://twitter.com/ShriramKMurthi/status/1191512734460006400) a date for RacketCon 2020 celebrating 25 years of Racket: October 17-18 in Providence, RI, USA.

# Project in the Spotlight

This week's project in the spotlight is [Marionette](https://github.com/Bogdanp/marionette/), a Racket library that lets you control Firefox via the Marionette Protocol. 

From the website:

# Featured Racket Paper

This issue's featured paper is [Option Contracts](https://drive.google.com/open?id=16CDd-t3_q8iI800xGpdxRU72jbykUGoc) by Christos Dimoulas, Robert Bruce Findler, and Matthias Felleisen.

Abstract:

> Many languages support behavioral software contracts so that programmers can describe a component’s obligations and promises via logical assertions in its interface. The contract system monitors program execution, checks whether the assertions hold, and, if not, blames the guilty component. Pinning down the violator gets the debugging process started in the right direction. Quality contracts impose a serious run-time cost, however, and programmers therefore compromise in many ways. Some turn off contracts for deployment, but then contracts and code quickly get out of sync during maintenance. Others test contracts randomly or probabilistically. In all cases, programmers have to cope with lack of blame information when the program eventually fails.
> In response, we propose option contracts as an addition to the contract tool box. Our key insight is that in ordinary contract systems, server components impose their contract on client components, giving them no choice whether to trust the server’s promises or check them. With option contracts, server components may choose to tag a contract as an option and clients may choose to exercise the option or accept it, in which case they also shoulder some responsibility. We show that option contracts permit programmers to specify flexible checking policies, that their cost is reasonable, and that they satisfy a complete monitoring theorem.

An implementation of [Option Contracts](https://docs.racket-lang.org/option-contract/index.html) is available in the package `option-contract-lib`. The require incantation is `(require racket/contract/option)`.
