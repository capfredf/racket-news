    Title: Racket News - Issue 28
    Date: 2020-03-16T21:00:00

Welcome to the twenty-eighth issue of [Racket](https://www.racket-lang.org) News. 

If you are a new contributor, welcome to Racket News. I publish this newsletter on the first Monday on or after the 1st and 15th of every month. I am working on improving the website and adding a couple of new sections to the newsletter. The upcoming new section will be a condensed digest in the form of bullet points of what's new inside Racket, i.e. in terms of commits to the official repos. 

Stephen de Gabrielle has been asking on a weekly basis what everyone has been working on - I am thinking of mentioning the most interesting work being currently done as well.

These are just a few of the several ideas I have to enrich Racket News through 2020. If you have any comments, suggestions or further ideas, [contact me](mailto:pmatos@linki.tools).

Grab a cup of coffee, and stay healthy!
Enjoy!

# What's New?

* Due to the current situation with regards to nCov-2019 virus, the previously scheduled meeting in London might be cancelled [as announced](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/qvqN2qUTj7g/IIet0MRtBQAJ) by Stephen de Gabrielle, so if you intended to go keep an eye on further updates. However, also announced is a After Work Racket London Picnic on Tuesday, June 16.

# Project in the Spotlight

This week's project in the spotlight is [Racket CAS](https://github.com/soegaard/racket-cas) by Jens Axel Soegaard.

From the website:

> RacketCAS is a computer algebra system written in Racket.
> 
> The system allows you to manipulate and compute with
> symbolic expressions from your own programs.
> 
> Symbolic expresions are represented as plain s-expressions
> and the names of mathematical operations are the same as in Racket.
> An expression like `3x+x^4` is thus represented as `(+ (* 3 x) (expt x 4))`,
> where `+` and `expt` are symbols.

# Featured Racket Paper

This issue's featured paper is [Feature-Specific Profiling](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13uyEIpp70tNbOdEslcq4m7mcZZKyKWoc/view?usp=sharing) by Leif Andersen, Vincent St-Amour, Jan Vitek and Matthias Felleisen.

Abstract:

> While high-level languages come with significant readability and maintainability benefits, their performance remains difficult to predict. For example, programmers may unknowingly use language features inappropriately, which cause their programs to run slower than expected. To address this issue, we introduce feature-specific profiling, a technique that reports performance costs in terms of linguistic constructs. Feature-specific profilers help programmers find expensive uses of specific features of their language. We describe the architecture of a profiler that implements our approach, explain prototypes of the profiler for two languages with different characteristics and implementation strategies, and provide empirical evidence for the approach’s general usefulness as a performance debugging tool.
