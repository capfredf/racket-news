    Title: Racket News - Issue 24
    Date: 2020-01-20T21:00:00

Welcome to the twenty fourth issue of [Racket](https://www.racket-lang.org) News. 
	
Things have been quiet during the beginning of 2020 in Racket world, so this will be a short one. In any case, a quick (and last) reminder to all Racket News contributors in 2019 to give me a shout (see [last issue](https://racket-news.com/2020/01/racket-news-issue-23.html#2019-racketnews)).

Grab a coffee and enjoy!

# What's New?

* Florian Volk ([@digitalvolk](https://twitter.com/digitalvolk)) has recently published a [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLasorM3KVewQ4ApnYTejOVdyB7TaR5iHK) with an online tutorial for Racket (In German).

Otherwise there is an *eerie* silence this time of the year...

# Project in the Spotlight

This week's project in the spotlight is [Terminal Phase](https://gitlab.com/dustyweb/terminal-phase) by Christopher Lemmer Webber. It is a space shooter game that runs in your terminal.

This game just made 1.0 and although pretty recent it's one of the most fun games I have seen in Racket. Also a test program for [Spritely Goblins](https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblins), an actor model library written in Racket and another project deserving a mention here.

# Featured Racket Paper

This issue's featured paper is [How to Evaluate the Performance of Gradual Type Systems](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fWCA9yelS0hyvtN3qittmvFZ2vsQayOt) by Ben Greenman, Max S. New, Daniel Feltey, Robert Bruce Findler, Jan Vitek, and Matthias Felleisen.

Abstract:

> A sound gradual type system ensures that untyped components of a program can never break the guarantees of statically typed components. This assurance relies on runtime checks, which in turn impose performance overhead in proportion to the frequency and nature of interaction between typed and untyped components. The literature on gradual typing lacks rigorous descriptions of methods for measuring the performance of gradual type systems. This gap has consequences for the implementors of gradual type systems and developers who use such systems. Without systematic evaluation of mixed-typed programs, implementors cannot precisely determine how improvements to a gradual type system affect performance. Developers cannot predict whether adding types to part of a program will significantly degrade (or improve) its performance. This paper presents the first method for evaluating the performance of sound gradual type systems. The method quantifies both the absolute performance of a gradual type system and the relative performance of two implementations of the same gradual type system. To validate the method, the paper reports on its application to 20 programs and 3 implementations of Typed Racket.
