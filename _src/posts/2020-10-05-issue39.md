    Title: Racket News - Issue 39
    Date: 2020-10-05T21:00:00
    Tags: DRAFT

Welcome to the thirty-eighth issue of [Racket](https://www.racket-lang.org) News.

Due to my summer holidays falling in awkward weeks we have seen only a single issue in September. However, we are back with our normal schedule. If you're ever in doubt check the [Racket News Milestones](https://github.com/pmatos/racket-news/milestones) for RN publishing dates.

Hope you're getting warmed up for [RacketCon](https://con.racket-lang.org) happening already next week. 

In the meantime, grab a coffee and enjoy!

# What's New?

* Have you ever thought that kickstarting a Racket app, library, gui app, command line app should be quicker? Well, meet [`racket-templates`](https://github.com/racket-templates).
    * Racketeers have been busy creating a collection of templates for Racket Apps and a `raco` command (`raco new <template>`) that makes a local copy of the template for adapt for your use case.
    * These templates are intended to be working examples that have base functionality you would expect:
        * `lang`: a #lang language template;
        * `gui-app`: a gui-app;
        * `raco-command`: extends raco to add a new command;
        * `cli-command`: a cli command template supporting command line arguments and piped input;
        * `web-app`: database backed web application including user registration/accounts, GitHub integration and modern front end utilising Jquery, Popper, and Bootstrap JS;
        * `package`: a Racket package;
    * Thanks to Philip Dumaresq (for creating the `raco` command, that also doubles as a template), Andre Alves Garzia for adding windows compatibility, Sam Tobin-Hochstadt for the `#lang` template, Jack Firth for the `package` template and Jens Axel Søgaard for the `web-app` template.

* Racket 7.9 release process is about to begin. Upcoming date (for October) are as follows:
    * 7th: Branch day, merge window starts
    * 15th: Merge window ends, testing starts
    * 22nd: Testing ends 

* Have you recently built Racket from source? Was it faster, better, both? Matthew Flatt spent quite a bit of time working on improving the Racket CS Garbage Collector in the last couple of weeks. If you have an application that uses many places or is particularly memory-heavy give a recent [snapshot](https://www.cs.utah.edu/plt/snapshots/) a try and report back.

* `rktermios`([src](https://gitlab.com/racketeer/rktermios)/[pkg](https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/rktermios)) is a librrary, working in both Racket BC and CS, that allows the programmer to set the terminal to raw mode by Dominik Pantucek.
* `qtops`([src](https://github.com/emsenn/qtops/tree/master)/[pkg](https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/qtops)) is a library providing procedures for performing operations on things with qualities by `emsenn`.
* `trie`([src](https://github.com/dstorrs/racket-trie/tree/master)/[pkg](https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/trie)) is a library that implements compact storage for nested data with overlapping elements, such as paths in a file tree by David Storrs.

# Call to Racket!

Want to contribute to Racket? Don't know where to start? Each RN issue I choose an easy issue to fix to get you started contributing to Racket. Come, give it a go.

Congrats to last issue's "Call to Racket" Champion `xxyzz`. He fixed issue [issue 2314](https://github.com/racket/racket/issues/2314) in [PR #3408](https://github.com/racket/racket/pull/3408) creating [commit 659741b](https://github.com/racket/racket/commit/659741bb5852d23ed6359ff420cb3db7f38d34cb). Thank you for your contribution to Racket.

The next one is [issue 3161](https://github.com/racket/racket/issues/3161) in [racket/racket](https://github.com/racket/racket). If you are interested in fixing this but need some guidance, feel free to comment on the issue page. Will you be our next Champion?

Good luck!

# Project in the Spotlight

This week's project in the spotlight is [Redex](https://redex.racket-lang.org/) by Robert Bruce Findler, Casey Klein, Burke Fetscher, and Matthias Felleisen.

From the website:

> PLT Redex is a domain-specific language designed for specifying and debugging operational semantics. Write down a grammar and the reduction rules, and PLT Redex allows you to interactively explore terms and to use randomized test generation to attempt to falsify properties of your semantics.
> PLT Redex is embedded in Racket, meaning all of the convenience of a modern programming language is available, including standard libraries (and non-standard ones) and a program-development environment. 

I cannot believe this project hadn't been featured before. It's an amazing project that you should definitely check out. There's a lot of [documentation](https://docs.racket-lang.org/redex/index.html) and a [book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/semantics-engineering-plt-redex) to keep you entertained.

# Featured Racket Paper

This issue's featured paper is [Profiling For Laziness](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nmKdCsbh_ULYqUDeOEdyJus6y2Buq5eN/view?usp=sharing), by Stephen Chang and Matthias Felleisen.

Abstract:

> While many programmers appreciate the benefits of lazy programming at an abstract level, determining which parts of a concrete program to evaluate lazily poses a significant challenge for most of them. Over the past thirty years, experts have published numerous papers on the problem, but developing this level of expertise requires a significant amount of experience.
> We present a profiling-based technique that captures and automates this expertise for the insertion of laziness annotations into strict programs. To make this idea precise, we show how to equip a formal semantics with a metric that measures waste in an evaluation. Then we explain how to implement this metric as a dynamic profiling tool that suggests where to insert laziness into a program. Finally, we present evidence that our profiler’s suggestions either match or improve on an expert’s use of laziness in a range of real-world applications.
