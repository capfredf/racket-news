Welcome to the thirty-first issue of [Racket](https://www.racket-lang.org) News. 

This is another full-to-the-brim Racket News! Lots of things are happening all around the Racket community, and slowly I am struggling to keep up-to-date. If I have forgotten something, [let me know](mailto:pmatos@linki.tools) and I will publish it in the next edition. 

Lets get going, grab an espresso and enjoy!

# What's New?

* The European Lisp Symposium 2020 took place online this year and it was quite a success. The videos [are online](https://www.twitch.tv/elsconf/videos) and include a keynote talk from Andy Keep on the Nanopass Compiler.
  * The [success](https://www.reddit.com/r/lisp/comments/ga7kfk/online_lisp_meeting_series/) of this year's virtual ELS prompted the creation of an Online Lisp Series. Stay tuned - there's [a mailing list](https://mailman.common-lisp.net/listinfo/online-lisp-meets)!
* Joel Dueck started a newsletter called [Pollen Time](https://buttondown.email/pollentime/) where he notifies subscribers about online events focused on pollen education and collaboration.
* Our own Robby Findler will be giving a talk on "Concolic Testing with Higher-Order Inputs" for the [Chalmers Online Functional Programming seminar series](http://chalmersfp.org/) on June 15th. This will be streamed online and an edited video posted later on their [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiGOzKde1rlvzEB7J73gvrQ).
* Due to the current worldwide situation, [Racket Summer School](https://school.racket-lang.org/index.html) was cancelled for 2020.

<small>Edit (2020.05.19): Added item on the Online Lisp Meeting Series.</small>

# Project in the Spotlight

This week's project in the spotlight is [Disposable](https://docs.racket-lang.org/disposable/index.html) ([src](https://github.com/jackfirth/racket-disposable)/[pkg](https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/disposable)) by Jack Firth.

From the website:

> This library defines disposables, composable first-class producers of values with associated external resources that must be allocated and deallocated such as database connections. Several safe abstractions are provided to consume disposable values while ensuring their associated resources are deallocated after use.

# Featured Racket Paper

This issue's featured paper is [Bithoven - GÃ¶del Encoding of Chamber Music and Functional 8-Bit Audio Synthesis](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wNcFOPny1F9zdZ2CWlWCj-4vqi6W0Rn7) by Jay McCarthy.

Abstract:

> Bithoven is a prolific composer of approximately `1.079363 * 10^239` different compositions based on four-part harmony and basic chord progressions. It is combined with a purely functional audio synthesis engine based on the Ricoh RP2A03, found in the 1985 Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). The synthesis engine is parameterized over a band of instruments and styles of play, so each composition can be played in one of approximately `4.22234 * 10^41` different arrangements or "NEStrations".
