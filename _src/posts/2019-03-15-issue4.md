    Title: Racket News - Issue 4
    Date: 2019-03-15T08:00:00

Welcome to the fourth issue of [Racket](https://www.racket-lang.org) News. If there's something you really dislike, or something you want to see added to the newsletter please [send me an email](mailto:pmatos@linki.tools) or [submit an issue](https://github.com/racket-news/racket-news.github.io-src/issues).

Jesse Alama has suggested I should try to add a table of contents to this week's issue - thanks for the suggestion. Again, let me reinforce the idea that I would love to have more contributions. If you see something that would like featured (blog post, mailing list post, news item, video,  project, library, etc) just [submit it](https://github.com/racket-news/racket-news.github.io-src/issues) and I will make sure it will be featured in the next issue. If there is a way I can facilitate contributions [send me an email](mailto:pmatos@linki.tools). I am worried that without contributions the newsletter becomes a biased source of what interests me most, instead of what might be actually relevant for the community. Is it easier to contribute if you just DM me on twitter? [Go for it](https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=pocmatos&text=RacketNews)!

# What's New?

* Stephen de Gabrielle is trying to organize a [London Racket Meetup](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/88RrCxns2J8/iBWCE_w6BwAJ). If you are interest, get in contact with him.
* A question by Marc Kaufmann on how to [fix typos in the documentation](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/J8ylMGGGr-8/lpscIJswAQAJ) led to the a [PR by David Storrs to add a `CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/racket/racket/pull/2523) to Racket. If you have some ideas on how to improve this, feel free to add a comment to the PR.
* If you are interested in software licensing, Joel Dueck added a [very interesting message](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/7tdOCIuV3q8/iJD63AJZCQAJ) to an [old thread](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/7tdOCIuV3q8/bsRucIUeFwAJ) about a new [BlueOakCouncil license](https://blueoakcouncil.org/license/1.0.0).
* William Bowman recently defended his PhD successfully. Congrats Dr. Bowman. On a long train ride? His thesis is available online: [Compiling with dependent types](https://williamjbowman.com/resources/wjb-dissertation.pdf).
* Matt Jadud started a mailing list [thread](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/7MCIp7RmTh8/IIJLsC9ADAAJ) about pretty display of tabular data that triggered a message from Alex Harsanyi on [how to reconcile all the efforts on data analysis](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/7MCIp7RmTh8/2_tfrDgSAwAJ) using Racket into a single library.

# Racket around the web

Here is a couple of posts I found for this issue, as usual, enjoy!

* [Writing a Simple Password Generator in Racket](https://alex-hhh.github.io/2019/03/password-generator.html)
* [Learn Racket by Example: GUI Programming](https://dev.to/goober99/learn-racket-by-example-gui-programming-3epm)

<div id='newreleases'/>
# New Releases

If you know of library releases or maybe your own libraries and you want them to be featured, please [let me know](mailto:pmatos@linki.tools).

* [Scribble Coq](https://github.com/wilbowma/scribble-coq) - William Bowman announced this new scribble library to typoset Coq going as far as running and auto-typesetting Coq examples as done by `scribble/example`.
* [Scribble Minted](https://github.com/wilbowma/scribble-minted) - Also by William Bowman, I have missed this announcement on a previous issue, scribble minted supports code rendering using `pygmentize`.

# Project in the Spotlight

The project for this issue is [Metapict](https://github.com/soegaard/metapict/) by Jens Axel-Soegaard. I find this to be one of the most underrated Racket projects I know of. More people should know about it and use it!

From the docs:

>The metapict library provides functions and data structures useful for generating picts. The library includes support for points, vectors, Bezier curves, and, general curves.
>
>The algorithm used to calculate a nice curve from points and tangents is the same as the one used in MetaPost.
>
>With this library I to hope narrow the gap between Scribble and LaTeX + MetaPost/Tikz. If you find any features in MetaPost or Tikz that you miss, donâ€™t hesitate to mail me.
