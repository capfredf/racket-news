Welcome to the twenty-first issue of [Racket](https://www.racket-lang.org) News. 
	
We are back to December and with it we have the end of the Racket GameJam and the start of Advent of Code (there's a Racket leaderboard - see below). Releases, Videos, competitions, blog posts, oh my! Lets go... 

Grab an espresso and enjoy!

# What's New?

* Racket 7.5 was [officially](https://blog.racket-lang.org/2019/11/racket-v7-5.html) released. RacketCS is not far off being production-ready. Quoting from the release post:

  > Racket CS remains “beta” quality for the v7.5 release, but its compatibility and performance continue to improve. We expect that it will be ready for production use by the next release. We encourage you to check how well the v7.5 CS release works for your programs, and help push the project forward by reporting any problems that you find.

  A shoutout to Asumu Takikawa, who maintains an [up-to-date](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/Qna88Mdc6aY/cC4fo-5TCgAJ) [Ubuntu PPA of Racket releases](https://launchpad.net/~plt/+archive/ubuntu/racket).

* Matthew Flatt's presentation on "A Racket Perspective on Research, Education, and Production" in ClojureConj 2019 [is now online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LN0qG-i1iT0) (don't forget the popcorn).

* [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) has started yesterday! If you are solving the puzzles in Racket, consider joining the Racket Leaderboard that [Sam Phillips created](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/swkwgjrHjX8/7L7l2op5AQAJ). Also, Matthew Butterick, in a similar fashion to previous years, keeps [posting his solutions accompanied by explanations](https://github.com/mbutterick/aoc-racket/) - but no peeking before you solve it.

* A further shoutout to [Racket Stories](https://racket-stories.com) which continues to have really interesting Racket related references - for your Racket shot in between Racket News issues.

# Racket GameJam

Special section for this issue... Racket GameJam!

<div style="text-align: center;">
 <img src="/img/issue21/gamejam.gif"/>
</div>

The Racket GameJam is now come to a close but it received [5 amazing entries](https://itch.io/jam/racket-2019-gamejam/entries) - time to play some games.

Stephen De Gabrielle just submitted the results - *drum-roll please*.

* *Best package*: [Racket code generator for Vulkan](https://zyrolasting.itch.io/racket-vulkan) by Sage Gerard

  This is a Racket package that generates Racket bindings for Vulkan. Use this for next-gen game engines, simulations, and research applications. The source code is available on GitHub along with detailed documentation.

* *Best Retrogame*: Two winners because Terminal Phase combined retro shoot-em-up with terminal graphics, but C64 robotfindskitten utilises the Racket asi64 assembler to create a C64 game - that is also a roguelike/zen-simulator. Both are amazing!

  [Terminal Phase](https://cwebber.itch.io/terminal-phase) by Christopher Lemmer Webber
  Terminal Phase is a space shooter that runs in your terminal!

  [C64 robotfindskitten](https://pezi-pink.itch.io/c64-robotfindskitten) by Ross McKinlay
  An implementation of the classic robotfindskitten “Zen Simulator” and is written in my Racket-based 6502 assembler, asi64 https://docs.racket-lang.org/asi64/index.html

* *Best Boardgame*
  [Racket-Onitama](https://dcsw.itch.io/onitama) by Dustin Wagner
  A great Racket implementation of the popular Onitama boardgame.

* *Best Puzzle Game*: [Groovee](https://tjm25225.itch.io/groovee) by tjm25225
  Stay in the groove!

* *Honorable Mention*: [RacketTown](https://github.com/hendrikboom3/rackettown) by Hendrik Boom
  Urban landscape generation library!

# Project in the Spotlight

This week's project in the spotlight is [`charterm`](https://docs.racket-lang.org/charterm/index.html) by Neil van Dyke.

From the website:

> The charterm package provides a Racket interface for character-cell video display terminals on Unix-like systems – such as for GNU Screen and tmux sessions on cloud servers, XTerm windows on a workstation desktop, and some older hardware terminals (even the venerable DEC VT100). Currently, it implements a subset of features available on most terminals.

This week's project in the spotlight is slightly different but just right for the season. It's [AoC Racket](https://github.com/mbutterick/aoc-racket/), which are the solutions with accompanying explanations to Advent of Code since 2016 by Matthew Butterick.

# Featured Racket Paper

This issue's featured paper (Tech. Report) is [FrTime: Functional Reactive Programming in PLT Scheme](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1N2R8N-ADLkait0LM6549LqOOz1Rf1B-q) by Gregory Cooper and Shriram Krishnamurthi.

Abstract:

> Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) supports the declarative construction of reactive systems through signals, or time-varying values. In this paper, we present a new language called FrTime, which provides FRP-style signals atop a dialect of Scheme. We introduce the language with a few examples and discuss its implementation. Unlike previous FRP systems, FrTime uses impure features, such as state and asynchronous communication, to model time and to control evaluation. The use of such features yields a scalable, event-driven implementation with several important advantages. Specifically, it eases integration with other systems, supports distribution of signals across a network, and permits various benign impurities. To illustrate the language's expressive power, we present a concise implementation of a networked paddle-ball game in FrTime.
