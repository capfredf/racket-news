    Title: Racket News - Issue 5
    Date: 2019-04-01T08:00:00

Welcome to the fifth issue of [Racket](https://www.racket-lang.org) News. 

Last week  Racketfest took place in Berlin, where I had the opportunity to meet some of you and have some great Racket time. It was an awesome event - thanks to Jesse once again for setting it up. Thank you for the support you showed for Racket News during the event! A last comment to point out that we have now passed 100 subscribers to the Racket News newsletter - you may have that extra espresso today in celebration of this momentous achievement.

In this issue, I have added a new section: [Featured Racket Paper](#featuredpaper). We all know Racket is born and nurtured in a state of the art academic lab where researchers do not sleep in order to bring us this amazing Programming Language. In celebration of this academic effort, I will start choosing papers related to Racket to feature in this newsletter. If you have a suggestion for a paper you would like to see featured here [let me know](https://github.com/racket-news/racket-news.github.io-src/issues).

Due to some travelling arrangements in the middle of this month, which will coincide with Issue 6 publishing date, I will either publish it a few days earlier or if there is not enough content, delay it until May 1st.

If there's something you really dislike, or something you want to see added to the newsletter please [send me an email](mailto:pmatos@linki.tools) or [submit an issue](https://github.com/racket-news/racket-news.github.io-src/issues).

Now, grab that cup of coffee and enjoy!

# What's New?

These last couple weeks were full of Racket. Here are a few things happening in the Racket World.

* Racket has made it into [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/) so give this [Kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/simple-macro-with-define-syntax-rule/train/racket) a try and if you want to see more Racket on the site consider contributing some Katas;
    * Available [Racket katas](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/racket) in CodeWars;
    * There is also a Racket track in [Exercism.io](https://exercism.io) - check it out and consider mentoring;
* A more accurate `tanh` function made it into the Racket repo through [PR 2565](https://github.com/racket/racket/pull/2565) by `bdeket`. If you are into numerical computing take a look, run some benchmarks and if something is off [let us know](https://github.com/racket/racket/issues/new);
* Philip McGrath mentioned, [on the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/M7wU5Ut4QBI/emt93xyFBQAJ), the [RealWorld](https://realworld.io/) project, which defines a *simple but realistic client-server web* application. If you would like to contribute a Racket example app, join forces with Philip at [Racket RealWorld App](https://github.com/liberalartist/racket-realworld-example-app);
* Alex Harsanyi has [improved](https://github.com/alex-hhh/racket-mode/blob/master/scribble-mode.el) on Greg's [racket mode](https://github.com/greghendershott/racket-mode) by adding better scribble support;
* There is an editor called [Kakoune](http://kakoune.org/), and it seems to also have Racket support. [Check it out!](https://bitbucket.org/KJ_Duncan/kakoune-racket.kak/src)
* There is also an editor called Vim... :)
    * recently I found there a [slightly dated DrRacket mode for Vim](https://github.com/rachitnigam/drracket.vim). Not sure it is usable but if you are a Vim user you might want to check it out and improve on it;

# Racket around the web

Do you blog about Racket? [Let me know!](mailto:pmatos@linki.tools)

* [Building a GUI Application for the Password Generator](https://alex-hhh.github.io/2019/03/password-generator-gui.html) by Alex Harsanyi

<div id='newreleases'/>
# New Releases

If you know of library releases or maybe your own libraries and you want them to be featured, please [let me know](mailto:pmatos@linki.tools).

* [Algebraic Racket](https://github.com/dedbox/racket-algebraic) by Eric Griffis - an extension for algebraic structures in untyped Racket

Algebraic structures provide the operational under-pinnings for algebraic
data types. What's missing is the static typing constraints.

The initial release provides a `#lang algebraic/racket/base` that extends
`#lang racket/base` with:

  1. first class, lexically scoped, naturally ordered data constructors;
     and

```
  > (data Maybe (Just Nothing))
  > (define maybe
      (function*
        [(n _ Nothing) n]
        [(_ f (Just x)) (f x)]))
  > (maybe #f values (Just 123))
  123
  > (maybe #f values Nothing)
  #f
```

  2. a consistent destructuring syntax for functions and macros.
  
```
  > (define fib
      (function
        [n #:if (< n 2) 1]
        [n (+ (fib (- n 1))
              (fib (- n 2)))]))
  > (map fib (build-list 7 values))
  '(1 1 2 3 5 8 13)

  > (define-syntax m-fib
      (macro
        [n:nat #:if (< (var n) 2) 1]
        [n:nat (+ (m-fib #,(- (var n) 1))
                  (m-fib #,(- (var n) 2)))]))
  > (list (m-fib 0) (m-fib 1) (m-fib 2)
          (m-fib 3) (m-fib 4) (m-fib 5) (m-fib 6))
  '(1 1 2 3 5 8 13)
```

The package is fully documented. The documentation includes the first of
three tutorials in a series on building interpreters with Algebraic
Racket.

Algebraic Racket is the first major milestone in a larger effort to
produce a complete language-oriented toolkit for integrating algebraic
structure into more sophisticated designs.

The project aims to:

  1. Implement and document the forms, functions, and syntax classes
     comprising Algebraic Racket for maximum potential reuse.

  2. Support the development of modular type systems and other
     language-facing components as libraries.

Pull requests of any size are welcome. For major changes, please start a
conversation on [racket-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/racket-users) or [open an issue](https://github.com/dedbox/racket-algebraic/issues/new) to discuss what you would like to change.

# Project in the Spotlight

I got several the suggestions for projects to highlight - thanks for that. I have queued them all for future issues. 

In celebration of the start of the triathlon season in Europe, I would like to feature one of the most polished Racket GUI applications I have seen implemented in Racket. 

By [Alex Harsanyi](https://alex-hhh.github.io/) the project in the spotlight is [ActivityLog2](https://github.com/alex-hhh/ActivityLog2). From its webpage.

>Import swim, bike and run and other activities from .FIT files. Display plots, scatter plots, histograms, maps and other views for activities. Show reports and trends from activity data and track equipment usage.

# Featured Racket Paper

We kick off this new section with the One Paper everyone should read: [The Racket Manifesto](https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/fffkbmt-racket-manifesto/paper.pdf).

By *Matthias Felleisen*, *Robert Bruce Findler*, *Matthew Flatt*, *Shriram Krishnamurthi*, *Eli Barzilay*, *Jay McCarthy*, *Sam Tobin-Hochstadt*.

Abstract:

> The creation of a programming language calls for guiding principles
> that point the developers to goals. This article spells out the three
> basic principles behind the 20-year development of Racket. First,
> programming is about stating and solving problems, and this activity
> normally takes place in a context with its own language of discourse;
> good programmers ought to formulate this language as a programming
> language. Hence, Racket is a programming language for creating new
> programming languages. Second, by following this language-oriented
> approach to programming, systems become multi-lingual collections of
> interconnected components. Each language and component must be able to
> protect its specific invariants. In support, Racket offers protection
> mechanisms to implement a full language spectrum, from C-level bit
> manipulation to soundly typed extensions. Third, because Racket
> considers programming as problem solving in the correct language,
> Racket also turns extra-linguistic mechanisms into linguistic
> constructs, especially mechanisms for managing resources and
> projects. The paper explains these principles and how Racket lives up
> to them, presents the evaluation framework behind the design process,
> and concludes with a sketch of Racketâ€™s imperfections and
> opportunities for future improvements.
