# What's New?

* Last week [RacketFest](https://racketfest.com), organized by Jesse Alama, took place in Berlin, Germany. Unfortunately, I was unable to join but from [the](https://twitter.com/mrcwhl/status/1233434679107358720) [several](https://twitter.com/joergenbr/status/1233157000441274369) [comments](https://twitter.com/alexshendi/status/1233163089337561095) [on](https://twitter.com/spdegabrielle/status/1233373042505658369) [twitter](https://twitter.com/THISISDINOSAUR/status/1233434296913887234) it seems to have been yet another success. Thanks to Jesse for RacketFest!
* Sage Gerard is [starting a syntax highlighter project](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/KgnocORsBt8/Wzrb7RuNBwAJ). If this is something that interests you, join the discussion!
* Would you be interested in a [Racket Meetup in London](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/sklZiVBOIGU/b9L4j5ktCQAJ)? If so, chime in!
* Stephen de Gabrielle ran a quick [racket editor survey](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/PdL-O9sFiVo/QUTxxdJiCQAJ), whose results are [now online](https://de.surveymonkey.com/results/SM-GBD6J7ST7/). The same survey took place in [slack as well](https://racket.slack.com/archives/C06V96CKX/p1582485281026300).
* Matthew Butterick started an interesting thread on coding differences between RacketBC (the current Racket - BC stands for *Before Chez*) and RacketCS. It is definitely [worth a read](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/r01YPGBDV-g/z0H-tRrPCAAJ)!

# Project in the Spotlight

This week's project in the spotlight is Cover ([src](https://github.com/florence/cover/tree/release)/[pkg](https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/cover)) by Spencer Florence.

From the website:

> This library is an extensible code coverage tool for racket. It comes with the ability to generate HTML reports, and has extensions to submit coverage reports to Codecov and Coveralls. You can also create your own coverage formats.

# Featured Racket Paper

This issue's featured paper is [Submodules in Racket: You Want it When, Again?](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wr2sMXqnj3kLhyXJLJBBIaVILEnxGO7W/view?usp=sharing) by Matthew Flatt.

Abstract:

> In an extensible programming language, programmers write code that must run at different times—in particular, at compile time versus run time. The module system of the Racket programming language enables a programmer to reason about programs in the face of such extensibility, because the distinction between run-time and compile-time phases is built into the language model. Submodules extend Racket’s module system to make the phase-separation facet of the language extensible. That is, submodules give programmers the capability to define new phases, such as “test time” or “documentation time,” with the same reasoning and code-management benefits as the built-in distinction between run time and compile time.
