    Title: Racket News - Issue 18
    Date: 2019-10-21T21:00:00

Welcome to the eighteenth issue of [Racket](https://www.racket-lang.org) News. 

If this is your first issue - welcome to Racket News. I have said this before but I should mention it once more. I cannot possibly catch every new single Racket app/post/package, etc on the web every single time. If you have been ignored in the past, it's just my fault and I would be happy for you to [send me an email](mailto:pmatos@linki.tools) to let me know of your activity. If you have further suggestions to improve Racket News [send them to me as well](mailto:pmatos@linki.tools).

Now on to the real deal, grab a flat white (my favourite while living in the UK) and enjoy!

# Project in the Spotlight

This week's project in the spotlight is [`dynamic-ffi`](https://github.com/dbenoit17/dynamic-ffi) by the David Benoit. 

From the website:

> This module produces automatic ABI-native ffi bindings to C libraries. Dynamic FFI is a native Racket extension which embeds clang/llvm to parse out declarations from C headers and dynamically build ffi objects with correct type/size information. This library is currently only availalable for GNU/Linux, but should be easily portable to other operating systems. If you are experienced with building clang/llvm plugins on other OSes and would like to contribute, please contact the author. This module uses native extensions to Racket’s C runtime, and is not currently compatible with Racket-on-Chez. Support for Racket-on-Chez is planned for the future.

# Featured Racket Paper

The featured paper for this issue is [Oh Lord, Please Don’t Let Contracts Be Misunderstood (Functional Pearl)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M47csz9x_sDYgVqHVpBoSWODvfsM_45_/view?usp=sharing) by Christos Dimoulas, Max S. New, Robert Bruce Findler, and Matthias Felleisen.

Abstract:

> Contracts feel misunderstood, especially those with a higher-order soul. While software engineers appreciate contracts as tools for articulating the interface between components, functional programmers desperately search for their types and meaning, completely forgetting about their pragmatics.
> This gem presents a novel analysis of contract systems. Applied to the higher-order kind, this analysis reveals their large and clearly unappreciated software engineering potential. Three sample applications illustrate where this kind of exploration may lead.
