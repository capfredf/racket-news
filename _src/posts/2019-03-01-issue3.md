# What's New?

# Upcoming Meetups

# Racket around the web

* [Building a Data Visualization Dashboard in Racket](https://alex-hhh.github.io/2019/02/data-visualization-dashboard.html): Sorry Alex, somehow I missed this one in my last issue. Another great post!;
* [Why LOP? Why Racket?](https://beautifulracket.com/appendix/why-lop-why-racket.html): Another beautiful appendix to the [Beautiful Racket](https://beautifulracket.com/) book by Matthew Butterick;

# New Releases

It is quite hard to manually track new releases in the Racket world because most libraries lack a release announcement process. This week I was asked to feature the release of a Racket library, so here it is.

* [PEG v0.3](https://docs.racket-lang.org/peg/index.html) released. From the website: "PEG can be thought of as an advance over regex. It can match more languages (for example balanced brackets) and can be paired with semantic actions to produce structured results from a parse."
* [Scribble Minted](https://github.com/wilbowma/scribble-minted) newly released. From the website: "A small Scribble library with support for rendering code using pygmentize."

If you know of library releases or maybe your own libraries and you want them to be featured, please [let me know](mailto:pmatos@linki.tools).

# Project in the Spotlight

Frog

# Help Needed

Do you know a project looking for contributors? I would love to hear about it.

* [Racket News](https://racket-news.com): Besides the obvious, _What would you like to see next?_ I could use a hand to make suggestions with regards to the website design. Using Frog with the Clean blog bootstrap4 theme but I am definitely way out of my league as soon as I need to do any CSSy stuff;
* [Chez on RISC-V](https://github.com/LinkiTools/ChezScheme/tree/wip-riscv): [RISC-V is on the verge of broad adoption](https://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1334311#) and I would like to see Racket running on RISC-V asap. That means getting Chez on RISC-V... if you are interested in compilers, architectures, and Racket, join in the fun.
