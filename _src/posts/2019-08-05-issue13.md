    Title: Racket News - Issue 13
    Date: 2019-08-05T21:00:00

Welcome to the thirteenth issue of [Racket](https://www.racket-lang.org) News. 

There has been an incredible amount of activity happening in Racket for the past 2 weeks so no matter how much I have included here, I am bound to have missed something - [let me know](mailto:pmatos@linki.tools) if I missed something you care about). Racket 7.4 is almost here and I was hoping it to be officially released before this issue but it hasn't happened yet. It's the first version being released with Racket CS by default (you can still get the old backend version though) - grab it, use it and [provide feedback](https://github.com/racket/racket/issues)!

Racket2 discussion has exploded and many, many words have been written about it, either on the mailing list, slack (which now has a [racket2 channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T06V8J4SU/CLKGAC44X/details/info)) or blog posts. Take a look at the links in this issue for the start of a few threads on this.

Grab an espresso and enjoy!

# What's New?

* Racket 7.4 is almost here... until then, you have to grab the [pre-release 7.3.0.900](https://pre-release.racket-lang.org/) to give it a go. In this version, and for the first time you can download the RacketCS version (i.e. still the Racket you love but running on Chez by default) - look for *Racket CS* and *Minimal Racket CS* on the [pre-release page](https://pre-release.racket-lang.org/);
* RacketCon 2019 videos are now online as a [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXr4KViVC0qJp4_2uTTAOjt-4URQBAR4c) for you to enjoy;
* We have a competition on-going in Racket land: [The Summer Competition of 2019](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/5OCfPsAirs8/TCzlzwRVEgAJ) organized by Stephen De Gabrielle;
* Besides Stephen's competition we have Amirouche's competition related to [static blog generators](https://git.sr.ht/~schemers/competition-2019-static-blog-generator#schemers-competition-2019);
* Racket2 has been the main conversation topic since Racket2 and much has been said about it; It would be foolish for me to try to summarize everything that has been said. Besides Matthews introductory to Racket2 quote above, you can find his two posts [here](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/3aIPOGbGgmc/A4HHSbdxAwAJ) and [here](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/HiC7z3A5O-k/XPR2wbSJCQAJ). Long threads follow with many other related threads that have inevitable sprung up on [racket-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/racket-users).
    * [Racket2 RFCs](https://github.com/racket/racket2-rfcs) is an official Racket project inspired by Rust's RFC process to serve as a starting point for the design of Racket2;

# New Releases

If you know of library releases or maybe your own libraries and you want them to be featured, please [let me know](mailto:pmatos@linki.tools).

* [deta](https://deta.defn.io/): by Bogdan Popa, it was [announced](https://defn.io/2019/07/16/ann-deta/) as a Racket library for mapping between database tables and structs - a bit like Elixir's Ecto;
* [racket-graphviz](https://github.com/pykello/racket-graphviz): by Hadi Moshayedi was recently announced on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/wQsWM5xG19E/pGC3b7CuEgAJ);
* [#lang magic](https://github.com/jjsimpso/magic): by Jonathan Simpson was announced too in the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/OT3XRR1OJHQ/wN7KvKW4EgAJ);

# Project in the Spotlight

This week's project in the spotlight is [Turnstile](https://github.com/stchang/macrotypes) by Stephen Chang, Alex Knauth, Ben Greenman, Milo Turner, and Michael Ballantyne. 

From the [documentation](https://docs.racket-lang.org/turnstile/index.html):

> Turnstile aims to help Racket programmers create typed languages. It does so with extensions of Racket’s macro-definition forms that facilitate implementation of type rules alongside normal macro code. As a result, the macros implementing a new language directly type check the program during expansion, obviating the need to create and call out to a separate type checker. Thus, a complete typed language implementation remains a series of macro definitions that may be imported and exported in the standard way that Racket programmers are accustomed to.

# Featured Racket Paper

The featured paper for this issue is by Jon Rafkind and Matthew Flatt: [Honu: Syntactic Extension for Algebraic Notation through Enforestation](http://www.cs.utah.edu/plt/publications/gpce12-rf.pdf). 

From the abstract:

> Honu is a new language that fuses traditional algebraic notation (e.g., infix binary operators) with Scheme-style language extensibility. A key element of Honu’s design is an enforestation parsing step, which converts a flat stream of tokens into an S-expression like tree, in addition to the initial “read” phase of parsing and interleaved with the “macro-expand” phase. We present the design of Honu, explain its parsing and macro-extension algorithm, and show example syntactic extensions.

Please note I am not hosting any of these files, but instead I am linking to the PDFs hosted by the researchers themselves. If you think there is a better way to do this or if I should host the files myself, [drop me a line](mailto:pmatos@linki.tools).
