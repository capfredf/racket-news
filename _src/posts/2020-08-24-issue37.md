    Title: Racket News - Issue 37
    Date: 2020-08-24T21:00:00
    Tags: DRAFT

Welcome to the thirty-seventh issue of [Racket](https://www.racket-lang.org) News. 

This comes a week after the normal planned issue but I have delayed it due to holidays. This will not happen again as the next issue will come out on the first Monday of September (September 7, 2020).

Congrats to Jesse Alama for fixing the first _Call to Racket_ issue. There's a new one for this issue.

Grab a coffee and enjoy!

# What's New?

* Matthew Flatt [announced](https://groups.google.com/g/racket-users/c/k_o3Ug-lK_s/m/HwhCtbC6BQAJ) that the [Utah Snapshots](https://www.cs.utah.edu/plt/snapshots/) site will switch to Racket CS by default.
* User `jcmdln` [proposed a bug triage party](https://groups.google.com/g/racket-users/c/Pf_011XdhLU/m/W2-Qy-Y7BAAJ) which was well received. For planning and further information join the `#triage` channel in [Slack](racket.slack.com).
* I have mentioned [Pollen Time](https://buttondown.email/pollentime) before but Joel Dueck keeps doing these on a regular basis and they are really interesting ways to get into Pollen, so take a look at the [latest one](https://youtu.be/bleu1mSAFuo) (as well as all the others).

# Call to Racket!

Want to contribute to Racket? Don't know where to start? Each RN issue I choose an easy issue to fix to get you started contributing to Racket. Come, give it a go.

Congrats to last week's "Call to Racket" contributor *Jesse Alama*. He fixed [issue #3336](https://github.com/racket/racket/issues/3336) in [PR #3341](https://github.com/racket/racket/pull/3341) creating [commit `b722d81`](https://github.com/racket/racket/commit/b722d810592dbfa1a668bf24eefce29d2773a0f2). Thank you for your contribution to Racket.

The next one is [issue 1400](https://github.com/racket/racket/issues/1400) in [`racket/racket`](https://github.com/racket/racket). Will you be the one fixing this one?

Good luck!

# Project in the Spotlight

This week's project in the spotlight is [`binaryio`](https://github.com/rmculpepper/binaryio) by Ryan Culpepper.

From the website:

> This library provides functions for reading, writing, and converting binary data. It is designed for the use case of implementing network protocols, although this library focuses on low-level support, not high-level protocol specification.

# Featured Racket Paper

This issue's featured paper is [Languages as Libraries](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IkIOKGIxfuzQTQWnZQ_H77CBHqCezY8W/view?usp=sharing) by Sam Tobin-Hochstadt, Vincent St-Amour, Ryan Culpepper, Matthew Flatt, and Matthias Felleisen.

Abstract:

> Programming language design benefits from constructs for extending the syntax and semantics of a host language. While C’s stringbased macros empower programmers to introduce notational shorthands, the parser-level macros of Lisp encourage experimentation with domain-specific languages. The Scheme programming language improves on Lisp with macros that respect lexical scope.
> 
> The design of Racket—a descendant of Scheme—goes even further with the introduction of a full-fledged interface to the static semantics of the language. A Racket extension programmer can thus add constructs that are indistinguishable from “native” notation, large and complex embedded domain-specific languages, and even optimizing transformations for the compiler backend. This power to experiment with language design has been used to create a series of sub-languages for programming with first-class classes and modules, numerous languages for implementing the Racket system, and the creation of a complete and fully integrated typed sister language to Racket’s untyped base language.
> 
>This paper explains Racket’s language extension API via an implementation of a small typed sister language. The new language provides a rich type system that accommodates the idioms of untyped Racket. Furthermore, modules in this typed language can safely exchange values with untyped modules. Last but not least, the implementation includes a type-based optimizer that achieves promising speedups. Although these extensions are complex, their Racket implementation is just a library, like any other library, requiring no changes to the Racket implementation.
