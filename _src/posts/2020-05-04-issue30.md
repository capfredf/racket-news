    Title: Racket News - Issue 30
    Date: 2020-05-04T21:00:00

Welcome to the thirtieth issue of [Racket](https://www.racket-lang.org) News. 

Here we go... 30 issues! It has been quite a journey since we started in early 2019, and I am happy to see that increasingly more people are coming to Racket, finding enjoyment in the language and actively participating in the community. This is also noticeable from the number of open issues and pull requests across the racket universe of [repositories](https://github.com/racket). Thank you all for following Racket News and for making the community better than ever!

The situation around the world is still complicated but things are slowly picking up in the Racket world. This issue is jam-packed with stuff. Lets get going!

Stay healthy and stay inside. 
Grab a coffee and enjoy!

# What's New?

* [Racket 7.7](https://blog.racket-lang.org/2020/05/racket-v7-7.html) is here and it's amazing. A lot of work has gone into it, which means you might find more niggles than usual. However, if you see any problem [report it](https://github.com/racket/racket/issues/new) and the racket team will be there for you. Here's a short selection of what you'll get from Racket 7.7:

	* Racket CS optimizations resulting in code size savings of around 20%.
	* Garbage collection is 10-20% faster in Racket CS.
	* Racket CS now supports a C API for embedding into other applications.

* There's been an on-going thread on [*on reducing barriers in the Racket community*](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/TU5n-Z_odLY/f2KzHK7eCQAJ) that started last year but [keeps on giving](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/TU5n-Z_odLY/vYk1jQmLAwAJ). Might be worth a re-read.
* Jesse Alama has [announced](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-dev/TaU3S0GZZbo/jtPD4IVTBwAJ) that work has started on porting Chez to ARM and RISC-V.
* Sam Tobin-Hochstadt [announced](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-dev/RjbOMW-Xmk8/Z_C4oJcIBQAJ) Racket is now on GitHub Sponsors so that's another available venue for donations to Racket. [Show your love!](https://github.com/sponsors/racket/).
* There has been an [interesting thread](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/4iI-SanIbzk/Lb-QzsfuBwAJ) on the mailing list regarding the state of the package system and the current inability to pin package versions. If you are a package system user and have opinions on this, chime in. 
* If you are a VS Code user, [Magic Racket](https://github.com/Eugleo/magic-racket) - the VS Code Racket extension - gains LSP support. Check it out!

# Project in the Spotlight

This week's project in the spotlight is [Heresy](https://docs.racket-lang.org/heresy/index.html) ([src](https://github.com/jarcane/heresy)/[pkg](https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/heresy)) by Annaia Danvers.

From the website:

> The Heresy language is a functional Lisp/Scheme dialect implemented in Racket, with syntax inspired by the BASIC family of programming languages. Its principle goals are to provide a simple core language for BASIC and other programmers to experiment with and learn how to program functionally.

# Featured Racket Paper

This issue's featured paper is [Typing the Numeric Tower](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vgUuqARJK8E64mFY_eyMLzKbaSlC-ZVU/view?usp=sharing), by Vincent St-Amour, Sam Tobin-Hochstadt, Matthew Flatt, and Matthias Felleisen

Abstract:

> In the past, the creators of numerical programs had to choose between simple expression of mathematical formulas and static type checking. While the Lisp family and its dynamically typed relatives support the straightforward expression via a rich numeric tower, existing statically typed languages force programmers to pollute textbook formulas with explicit coercions or unwieldy notation. In this paper, we demonstrate how the type system of Typed Racket accommodates both a textbook programming style and expressive static checking. The type system provides a hierarchy of numeric types that can be freely mixed as well as precise specifications of sign, representation, and range information — all while supporting generic operations. In addition, the type system provides infor-mation to the compiler so that it can perform standard numeric optimizations.
