    Title: Racket News - Issue 43
    Date: 2020-12-14T21:00:00

Welcome to the forty third issue of [Racket](https://www.racket-lang.org) News.

Here's another issue of Racket News just for you. I know - I know ... I missed Racket News last week on the 7th. I apologize. I have been extremely busy and it was impossible last week to publish Racket News. At this point we are in the middle of the month and entering Christmas season, therefore we will have a single issue this month and return with issue 44 year in 2021 with a yearly review. Lots has happened in Racket world during this year so stay tuned.

In the meantime, get cosy, grab a coffee, stay inside and stay safe.

Enjoy!

# What's New?

* Quite of few Racketeers have joined the holiday fun in trying to solve [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020/) in Racket. There's a private leaderboard for that. If you're doing it in Racket - join the fun. The leaderboard key is `22197-a7a01707` and there's also a slack channel to discuss AoC puzzles: `#advent-of-code` on the [racket slack](https://racket.slack.org).
* Typed Racket has opened its [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/racket/typed-racket/discussions). Take a look and join the community!
* Matthew Flatt's recent talk on ["Racket's Intermediate Language for Control" at VMIL2020 is online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG77a8stuDI&feature=youtu.be&t=26064).
* An oldie (from 2011) has re-surfaced and is making the rounds in the community: [Creating Languages in Racket](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2068896), an article in ACM Queue by Matthew Flatt on Macros.
* Federico Carrone has published an interview with Gustavo Massaccesi and Matthew Flatt on the [Rebuilding the Racket Compiler with Chez Scheme](https://notamonadtutorial.com/rebuilding-the-racket-compiler-with-chez-scheme-210e23a69484), it's worth a read.

# Project in the Spotlight

This week's project in the spotlight is [Urlang](https://github.com/soegaard/urlang) by Jens Axel Soegaard.

From the website:

> Urlang is a language designed to allow straightforward translation to JavaScript. Think of Urlang as JavaScript with sane syntax and JavaScript semantics. JavaScript in this context is short for ECMAScript 5 in strict mode.

# Featured Racket Paper

This issue's featured paper is [Macros for Domain-Specific Languages](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14XMPoRJgrmAJ934qDZSCQ8p8_rvNEe0b/view?usp=sharing) by Michael Ballantyne, Alexis King, and Matthias Felleisen.

Abstract:

> Macros provide a powerful means of extending languages. They have proven useful in both general-purpose and domain-specific programming contexts. This paper presents an architecture for implementing macro-extensible DSLs on top of macro-extensible host languages. The macro expanders of these DSLs inherit the syntax system, hygienic expansion, and more from the host. They transform the extensible DSL syntax into a DSL core language. This arrangement has several important consequences. It becomes straightforward to integrate the syntax of various DSLs and the host language when their expanders share these inherited components. Also, a DSL compiler may be designed around a fixed core language, even for an extensible DSL. Finally, macros empower programmers to safely grow DSLs on their own and tailor them to their needs.
