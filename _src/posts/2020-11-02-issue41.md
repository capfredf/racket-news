    Title: Racket News - Issue 41
    Date: 2020-11-02T21:00:00
    
Welcome to the forty first issue of [Racket](https://www.racket-lang.org) News.

We are jam-packed with information although we have recently noticed a lack of blog posts, so here's an informal call to blog posts. If you have a place to blog and post racket stuff, make sure that you post what you have been doing, some interesting thing you've seen lately, or just your experience with Racket. Let me know so I can feature it in the next issue.

Stay safe - grab an espresso and enjoy!

# What's New?

* Matthew Flatt will be presenting at this year's [VMIL2020](https://2020.splashcon.org/home/vmil-2020#program) on "Racket’s Intermediate Language for Control". You need to [register](https://2020.splashcon.org/attending/Registration) to watch it live but no doubt the videos will be made available afterwards so you can enjoy afterwards.
* Lîm Tsú-thuàn is creating a [Racket Taiwan](https://racket.tw/) community - they are on [twitter](https://twitter.com/racket_tw) and have a [discord](https://discord.gg/xpwzAcx) channel.
* Roman Kunin has created a full-fledged version of [Tetris in Racket](https://github.com/mosceo/tetris), check it out and have a play.
* Lindsey Handley and Stephen Foster have recently revived a 3d video game project called [CodeSpells](https://codespells.org/): a game where you can write any magic spell you can imagine using code. They are revisiting the project with moddability in mind, and of course they're using Racket. If you are interested in game development make sure you join the community. They have already had a [chat with Jay McCarthy](https://codespells.org/posts/lets-get-to-know-racket.html), that you should definitely check out.

# Call to Racket!

Want to contribute to Racket? Don't know where to start? Each RN issue I choose an easy issue to fix to get you started contributing to Racket. Come, give it a go.

Our Call to Racket Champion is Walter Yang who fixed [issue 3161](https://github.com/racket/racket/issues/3161) through commit [62f444d](https://github.com/racket/racket/commit/62f444d4e13f3a59f59d22f7fee70de63140e7b7). Congratulations Walter, thank you for your contribution. For next issue, we call on volunteers to fix [issue 813](https://github.com/racket/typed-racket/issues/813) of Typed Racket. If you are interested in fixing this but need some guidance, feel free to comment on the issue page. Will you be our next Champion?

Good luck!

# Project in the Spotlight

This week's project in the spotlight is [Futures Visualizer](https://docs.racket-lang.org/future-visualizer/index.html) by the Racket Team.

From the website:

> The futures visualizer is a graphical profiling tool for parallel programs written using future. The tool shows a timeline of a program’s execution including all future-related events, as well as the overall amount of processor utilization at any point during the program’s lifetime.

# Featured Racket Paper

This issue's featured paper is [Rash: form reckless interactions to reliable programs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d4ic7XxFQ0zImlNOk9SmsMJw11jSp8fa/view?usp=sharing) by William Hatch, and Matthew Flatt.

Abstract:

> Command languages like the Bourne Shell provide a terse syntax for exploratory programming and system interaction. Shell users can begin to write programs that automate their tasks by simply copying their interactions verbatim into a script file. However, command languages usually scale poorly beyond small scripts, and they can be difficult to integrate into larger programs. General-purpose languages scale well, but are verbose and unwieldy for common interactive actions such as process composition.
> We present Rash, a domain-specific command language embedded in Racket. Rash provides a terse and extensible syntax for interactive system administration and scripting, as well as easy composition of both Racket functions and operating system processes. Rash and normal Racket code can be nested together at the expression level, providing the benefits of a shell language and a general-purpose language together. Thus, Rash provides a gradual scale between shell-style interactions and general-purpose programming.
