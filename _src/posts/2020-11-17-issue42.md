# What's New?

* Stephen De Gabrielle and Sam Phillips are organising a [Racket Users Video Meetup in Gather](https://gather.town/app/wH1EDG3McffLjrs0/racket-users) (the same awesome platform used for RacketCon). The first one will take place November 28 at 11am PT (or 8pm CET). You'll need Chrome or Firefox as Safari apparently doesn't work. 
  * Agenda:
    * Lightning talks (< 5mins) - What have you been working on? (optional).
    * Paper for discussion (see [featured paper](#featuredpaper)): "Adding Interactive Visual Syntax to Textual Code" by Leif Andersen, (OOPSLA 2020).
    * Agree date for next meet-up (every 6-12 weeks?).
* [Ubuntu PPA](https://launchpad.net/~plt/+archive/ubuntu/racket) is now updated to Racket 7.9 - thanks to [Asumu Takikawa](https://github.com/takikawa/racket-ppa).
* [Galois](https://galois.com) is using Racket commercially - yes, you heard that right. Their main use of Racket is through Rosette. Take a look at their [blog post](https://galois.com/blog/2020/10/discovering-and-mitigating-emergent-computations-with-innovative-program-synthesis/) which has more information.
* Dominik Pantůček [has announced](https://groups.google.com/g/racket-users/c/VVmV7ER3huA/m/ngVU12vEBwAJ) RCGE, a [racket CPU Graphics Engine](https://gitlab.com/racketeer/rcge-tut25). It looks [pretty cool](https://joe.cz/rcge/) - check it out.

# Project in the Spotlight

This week's project in the spotlight is [Koyo](https://docs.racket-lang.org/koyo/index.html) by Bogdan Popa.

From the website:

> koyo is a web application development toolkit that expands upon Racket’s built-in web-server with all the functionality that a web app typically needs in a complete package.

# Featured Racket Paper

This issue's featured paper is [Adding Interactive Visual Syntax to Textual Code](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZU1lhEhiuh66J7n-lqPosA09mRtT-AF_/view?usp=sharing) by Leif Andersen, Michael Ballantyne, and Matthias Felleisen.

Abstract:

> Many programming problems call for turning geometrical thoughts into code: tables, hierarchical structures, nests of objects, trees, forests, graphs, and so on. Linear text does not do justice to such thoughts. But, it has been the dominant programming medium for the past and will remain so for the foreseeable future.
> This paper proposes a novel mechanism for conveniently extending textual programming languages with problem-specific visual syntax. It argues the necessity of this language feature, demonstrates the feasibility with a robust prototype, and sketches a design plan for adapting the idea to other languages.
