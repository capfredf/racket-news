Welcome to the seventeenth issue of [Racket](https://www.racket-lang.org) News. 
	
<!-- To all the new subscribers - and we have a few new ones, welcome! I hope to cover most of what is happening in the Racket Ecosystem but I might miss a few things as well so I am counting on you to [send me](mailto:pmatos@linki.tools) suggestions and comments, in case I have missed something. This issue might have more misses than hits given I have been away exactly since I published the last issue. Wish me luck on this one! -->

# What's New?

<!-- * Entries for the Standard Fish Summer Competitions [kept](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/5OCfPsAirs8/J6HqM2RVAwAJ) [coming](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/bbQuQIwgScc/q_5k12n2AgAJ) [until](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/Nw99GmP3ACs/Q2aBltCUDwAJ) the very last day. Surely Stephen de Gabrielle will have a hard time judging these entries. -->
<!-- * Manolis Ragkousis [asked for input](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/-IBChW7G4jY/HHiTO5ROBAAJ) for a proposals for Minimalistic Languages devroom in FOSDEM2020. -->
<!-- * A thread started by Sage Gerard regarding licensing and commercial turned into an interesting read mixing part software license discussions, part SFC related clarifications. -->

# Project in the Spotlight

This week's project in the spotlight is [Typed Racket](https://github.com/racket/typed-racket) by the Racket team. 

<!-- From the website: -->

<!-- > Typed Racket is Racket’s gradually-typed sister language which allows the incremental addition of statically-checked type annotations. This guide is intended for programmers familiar with Racket.  -->

# Featured Racket Paper

<!-- The featured paper for this issue is close to my heart. I started my first year studying in [IST, Lisbon](www.ist.utl.pt) on September 1999 - exactly 20 years ago. Our Introduction to Programming course followed [SICP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html) and the first order of business was to download and install PLT Scheme 103p1 - the rest is history. The featured paper is co-authored by one of the teachers of the subject back then - by Pedro Ramos and António Leitão: [Reaching Python from Racket](https://web.ist.utl.pt/antonio.menezes.leitao/ADA/documents/publications_docs/2014_ReachingPythonFromRacket.pdf). -->

<!-- Abstract: -->

<!-- > Racket is a descendant of Scheme, a language that has been widely used to teach computer science. Recently, the Python language has taken over this role, mainly due to its huge standard library and the great number of third-party libraries available. Given that the development of equivalent libraries for Racket is an enormous task that cannot be currently done in an acceptable time frame, the next best option is to allow the Racket platform to use Python programs and libraries. -->
<!-- >  -->
<!-- > We have been developing an implementation of Python for the Racket platform based on a source-to-source compiler. In order to provide good performance and good interoperability with the Racket platform, the runtime libraries are being implemented over Racket data-types. This, however, entails implementing all of Python's standard library on Racket and it does not provide access to popular Python libraries implemented using C module extensions (such as Numpy and SciPy). -->
<!-- >  -->
<!-- > This paper presents an alternative approach that allows libraries from Python's reference implementation to be imported and used in our Racket implementation of Python, immediately providing access to all of Python's standard library and every third-party library, including NumPy and SciPy. -->
<!-- >  -->
<!-- > The proposed solution involves importing Python module objects directly from Python's virtual machine, by calling the Python/C API through Racket's Foreign Function Interface, and converting them to objects usable by our Racket runtime libraries, making them compatible with the Racket platform. -->
<!-- >  -->
<!-- > This compatibility layer therefore relies on relatively expensive foreign function calls to Python's libraries, but our performance tests show that the overhead introduced by them is quite low and, for most cases, it can be minimized in order to attain the same performance as Python's reference implementation. -->

<!-- <small>Edit (03.09.2019): Tim Meehan pointed out to me that the link to the paper was not working in the first version.</small> -->
