# What's New?

* Matthew Flatt [posts another lengthy update](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/-x_M5wIhtWk/V47eL30HCgAJ) on Racket2 (now codenamed Rhombus) in the mailing list.

* Andre Garzia [asked](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/G6jvOJqUST4/VqX2bAzZBAAJ) in the mailing list if there was a web view for Racket. Lack of positive replies meant he ended up [publishing](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/33LwmR_eGRE/RryfMyo2BAAJ) his own.
* Jack Firth has [announced](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/YyjOTE3AlO0/GCwG0scDCQAJ) that his package [Rebellion](https://github.com/jackfirth/rebellion) has been tagged with [`hacktoberfest`](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) label and is ready for participants to join the event.

# Project in the Spotlight

This week's project in the spotlight is [Overscan](https://www.overscan.tv/), which is a live coding environment for live streaming video.

From the website:

> The overscan DSL can be used to quickly produce a video stream from a number of video and audio sources, send that stream to a video sink (e.g. Twitch), and manipulate that stream on-the-fly.

<div id='featuredpaper'/>
# Featured Racket Paper

This issue's featured paper is [Syntax Templates in Racket](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QZKJArx8XlSGOY4A-8uDvFBmhQZXqNsk) by Ryan Culpepper. 

Abstract:

> One foundation of Scheme macro systems is the notation of syntax patterns and templates. Patterns are used to match and destructure terms, and templates are used to construct new terms. This paper presents extensions to Racket’s template notation to support template splicing, conditional generation, and template metafunctions. The new template features complement syntax-parse’s previous extensions to the pattern-matching notation.
