# What's New?

* The [Racket Survey 2020](https://forms.gle/XeHdgv8R7o2VjBbF9) is here courtesy of Stephen de Gabrielle and Sam Tobin-Hochstadt. Read the [blog post](https://blog.racket-lang.org/2020/06/racket-survey-2020.html) and take a few minutes (10-15 mins.) to fill in the survey, which will be open until July 31st. 
* A quick reminder that besides the [Quickscript competition](#quickscript) we have also the [Summer Picture Competition](https://github.com/standard-fish/racket-summer-picture-competition-2020) ongoing.
* There's a new Wiki page on [Embedding Racket](https://github.com/racket/racket/wiki/Embedding-Racket) by Nathaniel Griswold - thanks for the valuable contribution.

# Quickscript Competition

[Quickscript](https://docs.racket-lang.org/quickscript) is the scripting functionality behind the DrRacket `Scripts` menu.

For the month of July we will be running a Quickscript competition: Write your own script and win prizes!
There will be weekly winners in categories to be determined by the judges and overall awards at the end of the month. 

We follow Racket's and the ACM's [Code of Conduct](https://racket-lang.org/friendly.html).

## There will be amazing prizes!

* An exclusive badge for your github profile recognising your efforts and contribution to the community. 
* Socks/Mugs/Hats/Stickers with the Racket logo - to be announced on Racket Users mailing list/google group.

Scripts licensed appropriately will be included in a package for installation and universal fame.

End date: 31-July (starting officially now)

## Getting started

[Getting started for the impatient](https://docs.racket-lang.org/quickscript/#%28part._.Make_your_own_script__.First_simple_example%29) in DrRacket.

See quickscript-extra [[readme](https://github.com/Metaxal/quickscript-extra/blob/master/README.md)] [[scripts](https://github.com/Metaxal/quickscript-extra/tree/master/scripts)] for a bunch of useful and example scripts.

Help and discussion will be available through the [#quickscript-competition](https://racket.slack.com/archives/C0168JZ2QUD) slack channel.

Once your script is ready, [submit your entry](https://github.com/Quickscript-Competiton/July2020entries/issues/new/choose)!

###  Need some ideas to get started?

Here's a script to open Racket News from DrRacket, submitted by Stephen de Gabrielle.

```racket
#lang racket/base

(require browser/external
         quickscript)

(script-help-string "Opens racket-news.com in the browser.")

; Launch https://racket-news.com in browser
(define-script racket-news
  #:label "Racket News (browser)"
  #:menu-path ("&News")
  #:help-string "Opens racket-news.com."
  (lambda (str) 
    (send-url "https://racket-news.com")
    #f))
```

Another good example is the [Open terminal here](https://github.com/Metaxal/quickscript-extra/blob/master/scripts/open-terminal.rkt) script. It will open a terminal in the same folder as the currently selected file on Linux, MacOS and Windows. You can get it by installing or updating the quickscript-extra collection, or just copy the source directly into your DrRacket script library.

# Project in the Spotlight

This week's project in the spotlight is [Cassius](https://cassius.uwplse.org/) ([src](https://github.com/uwplse/cassius/)) by Pavel Panchekha, Adam Timothy Geller, Shoaib Kamil, Michael Ernst, Zachary Tatlock, and Emina Torlak

From the website:

> The Cassius Project develops tools that understand how web pages render. Leveraging modern equation solvers, the Cassius Project hopes to develop a new class of verification, synthesis and debugging tools for web pages. 
> 
> The Cassius Framework is a mathematical formalization of web page layout, mostly implementing CSS 2.1. CSS is huge, so Cassius supports only a subset:
>
> * The CSS 2.1 box model: margins, padding, and borders
> * Min and max widths and heights
> * Percentage and em measurements
> * Colors, foreground and background
> * The inline, block, and inline-block display modes line-height and font-size position and positioning properties float and clear

# Featured Racket Paper

<!-- This issue's featured paper is [Sham: A DSL for Fast DSLs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YhOqflPWH4NLge3wX2FWK6HU6Olh9wsK/view?usp=sharing), by Rajan Walia, Chung-Chieh Shan, and Sam Tobin-Hochstadt -->

<!-- Abstract: -->

<!-- > Domain-specific languages (DSLs) are touted as both easy to embed in programs and easy to optimize. Yet these goals are often in tension. Embedded or internal DSLs fit naturally with a host language, while inheriting the host’s performance characteristics. External DSLs can use external optimizers and languages but sit apart from the host.  -->
<!-- > We present Sham, a toolkit designed to enable internal DSLs with high performance. Sham is itself a DSL embedded in Racket, but compiles transparently to LLVM at runtime. Sham is designed to be well suited as both a compilation target for other DSLs embedded in Racket as well as a language for transparently replacing DSL support code with faster versions. Sham programs interoperate seamlessly with Racket programs, and so no additional effort is required to use a DSL implemented with Sham. Finally, Sham comes with a framework for defining DSL compilers and transformations, which is also used in the implementation of Sham itself.  -->
<!-- > We validate Sham’s design on a series of case studies, ranging from Krishnamurthi’s classic automata DSL to a sound synthesis DSL and a probabilistic programming language. All of these are existing DSLs where we replaced the backend using Sham, resulting in major performance gains. -->
