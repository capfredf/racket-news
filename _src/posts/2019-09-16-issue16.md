    Title: Racket News - Issue 16
    Date: 2019-09-16T21:00:00

Welcome to the `0x10`th issue of [Racket](https://www.racket-lang.org) News. 

In the past couple of weeks, we saw the end of the Summer Standard Fish competition which showcased some amazing art and libraries in Racket - I will get into that later on. 

This issue I am trying to host the featured papers PDF files in an attempt to organize them into some sort of searchable list. Currently this is in a folder inside my Google Drive which I made public. If you have any suggestions or comments, don't forget to [drop me a line](mailto:pmatos@linki.tools).

Grab a latte and enjoy!

# What's New?

* Jens Axel-Soegaard just released an [amazing tutorial](https://github.com/soegaard/web-tutorial) on "How to Write Web Applications in Racket".
* Due to the work of Bogdan Popa, Jack Firth's [`racket-docker`](https://github.com/jackfirth/racket-docker) now supports [Racket CS docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/jackfirth/racket/tags).
* Only just noticed the existence of [Dali](https://github.com/johnstonskj/dali), a simple text templating library in the style of mustache/handlebars. From the repository it seems to be either stable or unmaintained.

# Project in the Spotlight

The project in the spotlight for this issue is [Racket Mode for Emacs](https://github.com/greghendershott/racket-mode) by Greg Hendershott. 

From the webpage:

> This provides a major mode to edit Racket source files, as well as a major mode for a Racket REPL. The edit/run experience is similar to DrRacket.

Racket mode powers the workflow of many of the Racket users that prefer to keep their lives inside Emacs. Check out the [docs](https://www.racket-mode.com/) once you install it - they are very thorough.

# Featured Racket Paper

This issue's featured paper is [Foreign Interface for PLT Scheme](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lE5HtY-z_Lh8jTiC4Au54m3pKXTUEBKo) by Eli Barzilay and Dmitry Orlovsky. This paper sets the foundations for what is today the amazing FFI library we all use and love.

From the abstract:

> Even a programmer devoted to Scheme may prefer using foreign libraries in certain situation. Connecting the two worlds involves glue code, usually using C, which requires significant programming efforts and system expertise. In this paper we describe a PLT Scheme extension for interacting with foreign code, designed around a simple philosophy: stay in the fun world, even if it is no longer a safe sand box. Our system relieves the programmer from low-level technicalities while keeping the benefits of Scheme as a better programming environment compared to C.

This issue is brought to you by [Paulo Matos](mailto:pmatos@linki.tools). Any mistakes or inaccuracies are solely mine and
they do not represent the views of the [PLT Team](http://www.racket-lang.org/team.html), who develop Racket.

I have also tried to survey the most relevant things that happened in Racket lang recently. If you have done something awesome, wrote a blog post or seen something that I missed - my apologies. [Let me know](mailto:pmatos@linki.tools) so I can rectify it in the next issue.
